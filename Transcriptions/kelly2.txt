So you can buy em in bulk there. I think I saw back there in the department where they have all the baby stuff. Just go back there and I think that just look where the baby wipes are. But look up and you'll see if they got em put the same way that they got them in this store, they got them on the very top shelf, and they got them in cases, so it's best to buy them in cases. That way you don't have to go and haul them every two or three days or whatever like that. I buy eight and ten boxes at a time because I use them for myself off too. I use them in the kitchen, I mean, in the bathroom. And basically anywhere I go, I take two packages with me. So you need you a portable package to carry, and then you need a bunch of them at home.
