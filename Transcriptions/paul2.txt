I was going to call Manuel. I was supposed to call on Monday and the system's down on Mondays. Then I called yesterday and it was busy until 1130. And then I called today and it's the wrong damn number. Yeah, he gave me the wrong phone number. There's some Latin guys, some Central American guy saying this is not the correct phone number. These days are one or a zero and the ten digit number and I was like, what the hell? It is ten digit if there's an area code and then just a regular phone number, that would make it ten digits. You wouldn't need the one.
