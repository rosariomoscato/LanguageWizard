Damn it's all curled up. There we go. That's better. I'm going to have this thing broken in. All right. You got a problem with that? I'm going to have this hat broken in. Is that cool? You don't want it broken in. Why not? You like it all geeky and sticking up real high. Oh sorry. That's broken in. Now know it looks cool. I don't know when I'm coming over. I might be working at the Arlington or the Hilton.
